# Hyper_stitch
Hyper_stitch is a GUI which uses key-point feature detection with RANSAC and ICP algorithms for stitching images together. This has been applied to stitching contiguous scanning electron diffraction datasets together.
## Installation and Dependancies
### Python Dependancies
hyper_stitch is largely built upon [openCV](https://opencv.org/) and [kornia](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
pip installing kornia should provide both of these and all other requirements:
```
pip install kornia
```
